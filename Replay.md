# The replay page

The replay page lists all the previous races that have been recorded to the `/data` directory.

![Replay page][replayPage]

On this page you can do the following things:

- Replay a previously recorded race
- Add and remove tags for a specific replay
- Add comments to a specific replay
- Stop any running replay (not fully working yet, as the race will still be logged to the console)
